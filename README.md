We propose a framework that learns physical properties of the content/object from unlabeled data.
We propose an unsupervised representation learning GAN, which explicitly encodes basic physical laws into the structure and use them, with automatically discovered observations from videos, as supervision.
We further explore directly mapping visual inputs to these physical properties, inverting a part of the generative process using deep learning.
